Update issues with DONE DATE in front of the issue number and add relevant details 
(link to PR etc) in a clear way when complete.




1. Merge joint_tp_read_structure into streamline_grandEXP and manage conflicts
2. Make joint_tp_read_structure the master branch on the 
   https://stash.pnnl.gov/users/snyd535/repos/fldgen repo
3. Get the IP release done for v2
4. Submit v2 JORS paper
5. Merge v2 into github master.
6. Make any new usability features introduced in streamline_grandEXP the default,
   v2.1 on stash/github as appropriate.
7. Making notation across my code and original code more consistent, wrappers, etc.
8. Enforcement of pairing in `trainTP` - currently, pairing relies on the fact that
   things get read in and processed alphabetically based on the shared CMIP5 style 
   scenario name. 
9. generalizing `trainTP` and `fldgen_object_TP` to work for dynamic number of
   variables (because `eof_analyze` will).
10. expand comment around the projection onto the zeroth basis vector in
    `eof_analyze`
11. tag issue for `eof_split` - largely a cosmetic/usability issue. Tags include the
    variable name in addition to scenario name, so there's some manual tracking of 
    what to use where. Right now, `trainTP` splits on the T tags, so that's the 
    naming convention necessary throughout calls during generating new fields.
12. wrapper for calling `train` versus `trainTP`. 
13. Address the precip physical 0 issue rigorously; hopefully through including a 
    transformation on precip (eg model log(P) instead of P) that converts the 
    problem to one where the residuals have support on -infinity to +infinity.
    Will also include some level of i/o tracking for whether a variable needs
    this kind of conversion and what to use; relative humidity will probably
    need logistic because the raw values live in [0,1]. As long as this
    additional transformation is a continuous, monotonic [increasing?] bijection 
    (smooth only helps), the full composite transformations will still be rank-
    preserving so the spearman corr coefficients across space and variables should
    still be preserved. Ie still have all the stats properties V2 currently has.
14. Short-term fix of precip physical 0 for grand experiment: when forming full 
    precip fields, if P<0 -> P=0. Per Kalyn, this only happens in 800 grid cells 
    out of 66k-ish in any given year (on average).
