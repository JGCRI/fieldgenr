\title{Using a trained emulator, generate new fields of residuals.}
\usage{
generate.TP.resids(emulator, ngen, method = 1, tvarunconvert_fcn = NULL,
  pvarunconvert_fcn = exp)
}
\arguments{
\item{emulator}{A trained \code{fldgen} temperature precipitation joint
emulator.}

\item{ngen}{The number of new fields to generate}

\item{method}{The algorithm used to generate new EOF coefficients, defaults
to 1.}

\item{tvarunconvert_fcn}{The function to undo any transformation done to the
input training data in \code{trainTP} to correct the support. This should be
the inverse function of the tvarconvert_fcn argument to \code{trainTP}.
Defaults to NULL as temperature typically doesn't need to be transformed to
correct the support. WARNING: currently rely on the user to define the
correct inverse function here.}

\item{pvarunconvert_fcn}{The function to undo any transformation done to the
input training data in \code{trainTP} to correct the support. This should be
the inverse function of the pvarconvert_fcn argument to \code{trainTP}.
Defaults to exp() as precipitation is usually log-transformed in ordere to
correct the support. WARNING: currently rely on the user to define the
correct inverse function here.}
}
\value{
A list of new residual fields, each entry in the list is a new
realization, a matrix that is [Nyears x 2 * Ngrid]; the first 1:Ngrid cols
are the temperature residuals and columns (Ngrid + 1):(2*Ngrid) are the
precipitation residuals.
}
\description{
This function takes in a trained emulator - a structure of class
\code{fldgen}.
This structure contains everything the emulator has learned about the model,
and is used to generate new fields of residuals.
}
\details{
First, new residuals are generated. The distribution of residuals over time
for each variable in each grid cell is N(0,1). These generated residuals are
then mapped back to the native distribution for each variable's residuals
in each grid cell.
